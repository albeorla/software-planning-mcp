# Domain Model Analysis & DDD Implementation Plan

This document provides an updated analysis of our domain model implementation against Domain-Driven Design principles and outlines a specific implementation plan for improvements. This is a living document that will be updated as our domain model evolves.

## Current State Analysis (Updated)

### Bounded Contexts

Our system is well-organized into these bounded contexts:

1. **Planning Context**
   - Focus: Strategic planning and task management
   - Key entities: Goal, ImplementationPlan, Todo, Roadmap, RoadmapNote
   - Repositories: GoalRepository, ImplementationPlanRepository, RoadmapRepository, RoadmapNoteRepository
   - Application Services: PlanningService, RoadmapApplicationService, RoadmapCommandService, RoadmapQueryService

2. **Documentation Context**
   - Focus: Managing documentation artifacts
   - Key entities: PRD, Epic, Story, Task
   - Application Service: DocumentationService

3. **Thinking Context**
   - Focus: Recording and managing thinking processes
   - Key entities: ThinkingProcess, Thought
   - Repository: ThinkingProcessRepository
   - Application Service: ThinkingService

4. **Version Control Context**
   - Focus: Managing source control operations
   - Key responsibilities: Commit, branch, and PR management
   - Application Service: VersionControlService

### Current Metrics (Top Files by Size, Updated)

```
src/application/roadmap/commands/CompositeRoadmapCommandService.ts 374 lines
src/application/roadmap/RoadmapCommandService.ts 371 lines
src/application/DocumentTemplates.ts 485 lines
src/application/TemplateService.ts 336 lines
src/domain/entities/roadmap/Roadmap.ts 297 lines
src/application/DocumentationService.ts 285 lines
```

The original large `RoadmapService.ts` (597 lines) has been successfully refactored following CQRS and the Single Responsibility Principle, but two files still exceed our line limit:

- `src/application/roadmap/commands/CompositeRoadmapCommandService.ts`: 374 lines
- `src/application/roadmap/RoadmapCommandService.ts`: 371 lines

These command services should be our next refactoring targets.

The original `Roadmap.ts` (689 lines) has been successfully split into more manageable files:
- `src/domain/entities/roadmap/Roadmap.ts`: 297 lines
- `src/domain/entities/roadmap/RoadmapTimeframe.ts`: 189 lines
- `src/domain/entities/roadmap/RoadmapInitiative.ts`: 190 lines
- `src/domain/entities/roadmap/RoadmapItem.ts`: 163 lines
- `src/domain/entities/roadmap/index.ts`: 4 lines

The original `RoadmapHandlers.ts` (666 lines) has also been split into more focused components:
- `src/governance/handlers/planning/roadmap/RoadmapManagementHandlers.ts`: 208 lines
- `src/governance/handlers/planning/roadmap/RoadmapNoteHandlers.ts`: 182 lines
- `src/governance/handlers/planning/roadmap/components/RoadmapComponentHandlers.ts`: ~200 lines (estimated)
- `src/governance/handlers/planning/roadmap/index.ts`: 2 lines

### Strengths

1. **Clear Bounded Context Separation**
   - Each context has its own entities, repositories, and services
   - Clear responsibilities with minimal overlap

2. **Entity Design**
   - Rich domain models with behavior (not anemic)
   - Factory methods for object creation (e.g., `Roadmap.create()`)
   - Immutability pattern for state changes
   - Clear identity management

3. **Repository Pattern**
   - Clean abstractions for persistence concerns
   - Repositories focused on aggregate roots
   - Interface-based design enabling different implementations

4. **Application Services**
   - Orchestrate domain logic and cross-entity operations
   - Follow single responsibility principle
   - Good separation from domain logic

5. **Domain-Specific Language**
   - Entity names reflect ubiquitous language (Roadmap, Initiative, Epic, etc.)
   - Methods use domain terminology
   
6. **Tool Organization Improvements**
   - Refactored ToolDefinitionsFactory.ts into smaller category-based files
   - Added metrics tracking to identify large files

7. **Value Objects**
   - Implemented proper value objects for Priority, Status, and Category
   - Encapsulated validation and behavior
   - Enhanced type safety

8. **Domain Events**
   - Implemented event-based communication between aggregates
   - Created EventDispatcher for handling domain events
   - Enhanced decoupling between components

9. **Domain Services**
   - Added dedicated domain services for cross-entity operations
   - Improved encapsulation of business rules

### Areas for Improvement

1. **✅ File Organization for Domain Entities and Handlers** (COMPLETED)
   - ✓ Split large domain entity files into separate files with focused responsibilities
   - ✓ Split large handler files into more focused components
   - ✓ Maintain backward compatibility with re-exports and deprecation notices
   - ✓ Improved maintainability by following Single Responsibility Principle

2. **✅ Primitive Obsession** (COMPLETED)
   - ✓ Implemented value objects for Priority, Status, and Category
   - ✓ Updated entities to use value objects instead of primitive types
   - ✓ Improved type safety and encapsulation of domain rules

3. **✅ Missing Domain Events** (COMPLETED)
   - ✓ Implemented domain event infrastructure
   - ✓ Created event classes for key domain events
   - ✓ Added event dispatching to repositories and services

4. **✅ Inadequate Domain Services** (COMPLETED)
   - ✓ Created domain services for cross-entity operations
   - ✓ Moved business rules from application services to domain services

5. **Large Application Services** (IN PROGRESS)
   - CompositeRoadmapCommandService.ts (374 lines) needs further refactoring
   - RoadmapCommandService.ts (371 lines) needs further refactoring
   - Further splitting into more focused components needed

## Implementation Plan

### Immediate Priority: Refactor Large Command Services

1. **Split CompositeRoadmapCommandService.ts**
   - Extract specialized operations into separate service classes

- ✓ Added concrete event classes for roadmap domain events
- ✓ Updated entities to register events during state changes
- ✓ Created event handlers for cross-aggregate coordination

✅ **Phase 6: Add Domain Services**

- ✓ Updated application services to use domain services
- ✓ Moved cross-entity business rules from application to domain layer

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 7: Refactor CompositeRoadmapCommandService**
   - Split into more focused service classes
   - Apply same patterns as previous refactorings
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Phase 8: Refactor RoadmapCommandService**

   - Improve separation of concerns
   - Reduce complexity and file size

3. **Phase 9: Improve Test Coverage**
   - Add comprehensive unit tests for domain entities and value objects
   - Add integration tests for application services
   - Ensure refactored components maintain correct behavior

## Code Quality Enforcement

To ensure consistent code quality and prevent regression of our improvements, we've implemented automated checks:

### Line Length Checking

We've added automatic line length checking to prevent files from getting too large:

1. **Manual checking**: Use `pnpm run count-lines [threshold]` to identify files exceeding the specified line count (default: 300)
2. **Git hooks**: Pre-commit hooks automatically block commits with files exceeding 400 lines

### Git Hooks Setup

We use Husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality standards:

1. **Pre-commit checks**:
   - File line length validation (maximum 400 lines per file)
   - TypeScript type checking on staged files
   
2. **Installation and configuration**:
   - Husky is automatically installed via the `prepare` script
   - Configuration is stored in `.husky/pre-commit` and `package.json`

## Conclusion

Our domain model has been significantly improved through targeted refactoring efforts. We've successfully implemented DDD principles including rich domain models, value objects, domain events, and domain services. The codebase is now more maintainable, expressive, and aligned with domain concepts.

The next phase of refactoring will focus on further reducing the size and complexity of our command services, while maintaining the high standards we've established for code organization and domain modeling.
