# Domain Model Analysis & DDD Implementation Plan

This document provides an updated analysis of our domain model implementation against Domain-Driven Design principles and outlines a specific implementation plan for improvements. This is a living document that will be updated as our domain model evolves.

## Current State Analysis (Updated)

### Bounded Contexts

Our system is well-organized into these bounded contexts:

1. **Planning Context**
   - Focus: Strategic planning and task management
   - Key entities: Goal, ImplementationPlan, Todo, Roadmap, RoadmapNote
   - Repositories: GoalRepository, ImplementationPlanRepository, RoadmapRepository, RoadmapNoteRepository
   - Application Services: PlanningService, RoadmapService

2. **Documentation Context**
   - Focus: Managing documentation artifacts
   - Key entities: PRD, Epic, Story, Task
   - Application Service: DocumentationService

3. **Thinking Context**
   - Focus: Recording and managing thinking processes
   - Key entities: ThinkingProcess, Thought
   - Repository: ThinkingProcessRepository
   - Application Service: ThinkingService

4. **Version Control Context**
   - Focus: Managing source control operations
   - Key responsibilities: Commit, branch, and PR management
   - Application Service: VersionControlService

### Current Metrics (Top 10 Files by Size, Updated)

```

The original large `RoadmapService.ts` (597 lines) has been successfully refactored following CQRS:
- `src/application/roadmap/RoadmapApplicationService.ts`: 323 lines (Facade combining query and command)
- `src/application/roadmap/RoadmapCommandService.ts`: 273 lines (Write operations)
- `src/application/roadmap/RoadmapQueryService.ts`: 193 lines (Read operations)
- `src/application/roadmap/index.ts`: 3 lines (Exports)
- Original `src/application/RoadmapService.ts`: 97 lines (Backward compatibility facade)

The original `Roadmap.ts` (689 lines) has been successfully split into more manageable files:
- `src/domain/entities/roadmap/Roadmap.ts`: 297 lines
- `src/domain/entities/roadmap/RoadmapTimeframe.ts`: 189 lines
- `src/domain/entities/roadmap/RoadmapInitiative.ts`: 190 lines
- `src/domain/entities/roadmap/RoadmapItem.ts`: 163 lines
- `src/domain/entities/roadmap/index.ts`: 4 lines
- Original `src/domain/entities/Roadmap.ts`: 19 lines (backward compatibility)

The original `RoadmapHandlers.ts` (666 lines) has also been split into more focused components:
- `src/governance/handlers/planning/roadmap/RoadmapManagementHandlers.ts`: 208 lines
- `src/governance/handlers/planning/roadmap/RoadmapNoteHandlers.ts`: 182 lines
- `src/governance/handlers/planning/roadmap/index.ts`: 2 lines
- Original `src/governance/handlers/planning/RoadmapHandlers.ts`: 278 lines (backward compatibility with deprecation notices)

### Strengths

1. **Clear Bounded Context Separation**
   - Each context has its own entities, repositories, and services
   - Clear responsibilities with minimal overlap

2. **Entity Design**
   - Rich domain models with behavior (not anemic)
   - Factory methods for object creation (e.g., `Roadmap.create()`)
   - Immutability pattern for state changes
   - Clear identity management

3. **Repository Pattern**
   - Clean abstractions for persistence concerns
   - Repositories focused on aggregate roots
   - Interface-based design enabling different implementations

4. **Application Services**
   - Orchestrate domain logic and cross-entity operations
   - Follow single responsibility principle
   - Good separation from domain logic

5. **Domain-Specific Language**
   - Entity names reflect ubiquitous language (Roadmap, Initiative, Epic, etc.)
   - Methods use domain terminology
   
6. **Tool Organization Improvements**
   - Recent refactoring of ToolDefinitionsFactory.ts into smaller category-based files
   - Added metrics tracking to identify large files

### Areas for Improvement

1. **✅ File Organization for Domain Entities and Handlers** (COMPLETED)
   - ✓ Split large domain entity files into separate files with focused responsibilities
   - ✓ Split large handler files into more focused components
   - ✓ Maintain backward compatibility with re-exports and deprecation notices
   - ✓ Improved maintainability by following Single Responsibility Principle
   
   Remaining file organization issues:
   ```
   src/application/RoadmapService.ts - 597 lines
   ```
   - This file still exceeds recommended limits and should be split into more focused modules

2. **Primitive Obsession**
   - Extensive use of primitive types instead of domain value objects
   - Examples from Roadmap.ts:
     ```typescript
     public readonly priority: string; // Should be a Priority value object
     public readonly status: string;   // Should be a Status value object
     public readonly category: string; // Should be a Category value object
     ```
   - Domain meaning and validation are scattered rather than encapsulated

3. **Missing Domain Events**
   - No mechanism for entities to communicate state changes across aggregates
   - Changes in one aggregate don't trigger appropriate actions in others
   - Example: When a Roadmap item changes status, related Tasks aren't notified

4. **Inadequate Domain Services**
   - Business rules that span entities are placed in application services
   - No explicit domain services for operations that don't belong to a single entity
   - Example: Priority balancing across initiatives should be a domain service

5. **Large Application Services**
   - Some application services are too large (RoadmapService: 597 lines)
   - Mix too many responsibilities and use cases
   - Should be split into more focused services

6. **Limited Invariant Enforcement**
   - Domain invariants are enforced inconsistently
   - Some rules are spread across the codebase rather than centralized
   - Example: Validation that a timeframe can only contain a certain number of high-priority initiatives

7. **Unimplemented Value Objects**
   - No explicit value objects for important domain concepts
   - Primitive types used for values with domain meaning
   - Prevents proper domain rule enforcement

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Split Large Aggregate Files (Highest Priority)

**Starting with Roadmap.ts:**

1. Create the directory structure:
   ```
   src/domain/entities/roadmap/
   ```

2. Extract each entity into its own file:
   - `Roadmap.ts` (aggregate root)
   - `RoadmapTimeframe.ts`
   - `RoadmapInitiative.ts`
   - `RoadmapItem.ts`
   - `index.ts` (for re-exports)

3. Example implementation:

```typescript
// src/domain/entities/roadmap/Roadmap.ts
import { RoadmapTimeframe } from './RoadmapTimeframe.js';

export class Roadmap {
  public readonly id: string;
  public readonly title: string;
  public readonly description: string;
  public readonly version: string;
  public readonly owner: string;
  private readonly _timeframes: Map<string, RoadmapTimeframe>;
  public readonly createdAt: string;
  public readonly updatedAt: string;

  private constructor(
    id: string,
    title: string,
    description: string,
    version: string,
    owner: string,
    timeframes: Map<string, RoadmapTimeframe>,
    createdAt: string,
    updatedAt: string
  ) {
    this.id = id;
    this.title = title;
    this.description = description;
    this.version = version;
    this.owner = owner;
    this._timeframes = timeframes;
    this.createdAt = createdAt;
    this.updatedAt = updatedAt;
  }

  // Rest of the implementation...
}
```

```typescript
// src/domain/entities/roadmap/index.ts
export * from './Roadmap.js';
export * from './RoadmapTimeframe.js';
export * from './RoadmapInitiative.js';
export * from './RoadmapItem.js';
```

### Phase 2: Implement Value Objects

1. Create a `value-objects` directory:
   ```
   src/domain/value-objects/
   ```

2. Implement key value objects:

```typescript
// src/domain/value-objects/Priority.ts
export class Priority {
  private constructor(private readonly value: string) {
    if (!['high', 'medium', 'low'].includes(value.toLowerCase())) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid priority value: ${value}`);
    }
  }
  
  public static readonly HIGH = new Priority('high');
  public static readonly MEDIUM = new Priority('medium');
  public static readonly LOW = new Priority('low');
  
  public static fromString(value: string): Priority {
    const normalizedValue = value.toLowerCase();
    if (normalizedValue === 'high') return Priority.HIGH;
    if (normalizedValue === 'medium') return Priority.MEDIUM;
    if (normalizedValue === 'low') return Priority.LOW;
    throw new Error(`Invalid priority value: ${value}`);
  }
  
  public equals(other: Priority): boolean {
    return this.value === other.value;
  }
  
  public toString(): string {
    return this.value;
  }
  
  public get isHigh(): boolean {
    return this.value === 'high';
  }
  
  public get isMedium(): boolean {
    return this.value === 'medium';
  }
  
  public get isLow(): boolean {
    return this.value === 'low';
  }
}
```

```typescript
// src/domain/value-objects/Status.ts
export class Status {
  private constructor(private readonly value: string) {
    if (!['planned', 'in-progress', 'completed', 'canceled'].includes(value.toLowerCase())) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid status value: ${value}`);
    }
  }
  
  public static readonly PLANNED = new Status('planned');
  public static readonly IN_PROGRESS = new Status('in-progress');
  public static readonly COMPLETED = new Status('completed');
  public static readonly CANCELED = new Status('canceled');
  
  public static fromString(value: string): Status {
    const normalizedValue = value.toLowerCase();
    if (normalizedValue === 'planned') return Status.PLANNED;
    if (normalizedValue === 'in-progress') return Status.IN_PROGRESS;
    if (normalizedValue === 'completed') return Status.COMPLETED;
    if (normalizedValue === 'canceled') return Status.CANCELED;
    throw new Error(`Invalid status value: ${value}`);
  }
  
  public equals(other: Status): boolean {
    return this.value === other.value;
  }
  
  public toString(): string {
    return this.value;
  }
  
  public get isActive(): boolean {
    return this.value === 'planned' || this.value === 'in-progress';
  }
  
  public get isCompleted(): boolean {
    return this.value === 'completed';
  }
  
  public get isCanceled(): boolean {
    return this.value === 'canceled';
  }
}
```

3. Update the roadmap entities to use these value objects:

```typescript
// Updated RoadmapInitiative.ts snippet
import { Priority } from '../../value-objects/Priority.js';
import { Category } from '../../value-objects/Category.js';

export class RoadmapInitiative {
  public readonly id: string;
  public readonly title: string;
  public readonly description: string;
  public readonly category: Category;  // Now a value object
  public readonly priority: Priority;  // Now a value object
  private readonly _items: Map<string, RoadmapItem>;
  
  // Rest of implementation updated to use value objects
}
```

### Phase 3: Implement Domain Events

1. Create the event infrastructure:

```typescript
// src/domain/events/DomainEvent.ts
export interface DomainEvent {
  readonly occurredOn: Date;
  readonly eventType: string;
}
```

```typescript
// src/domain/events/EventDispatcher.ts
import { DomainEvent } from './DomainEvent.js';

type EventHandler = (event: DomainEvent) => void;

export class EventDispatcher {
  private static instance: EventDispatcher;
  private handlers: Map<string, EventHandler[]> = new Map();
  
  private constructor() {}
  
  public static getInstance(): EventDispatcher {
    if (!EventDispatcher.instance) {
      EventDispatcher.instance = new EventDispatcher();
    }
    return EventDispatcher.instance;
  }
  
  public register(eventType: string, handler: EventHandler): void {
    const handlers = this.handlers.get(eventType) || [];
    handlers.push(handler);
    this.handlers.set(eventType, handlers);
  }
  
  public dispatch(event: DomainEvent): void {
    const handlers = this.handlers.get(event.eventType) || [];
    handlers.forEach(handler => handler(event));
  }
}
```

2. Create specific events:

```typescript
// src/domain/events/RoadmapEvents.ts
import { DomainEvent } from './DomainEvent.js';
import { Status } from '../value-objects/Status.js';
import { Priority } from '../value-objects/Priority.js';

export class RoadmapItemStatusChanged implements DomainEvent {
  readonly occurredOn: Date;
  readonly eventType = 'RoadmapItemStatusChanged';
  
  constructor(
    public readonly roadmapId: string,
    public readonly timeframeId: string,
    public readonly initiativeId: string,
    public readonly itemId: string,
    public readonly oldStatus: Status,
    public readonly newStatus: Status
  ) {
    this.occurredOn = new Date();
  }
}

export class RoadmapInitiativePriorityChanged implements DomainEvent {
  readonly occurredOn: Date;
  readonly eventType = 'RoadmapInitiativePriorityChanged';
  
  constructor(
    public readonly roadmapId: string,
    public readonly timeframeId: string,
    public readonly initiativeId: string,
    public readonly oldPriority: Priority,
    public readonly newPriority: Priority
  ) {
    this.occurredOn = new Date();
  }
}
```

3. Update entities to register events:

```typescript
// src/domain/entities/roadmap/RoadmapItem.ts (snippet)
import { Status } from '../../value-objects/Status.js';
import { DomainEvent } from '../../events/DomainEvent.js';
import { RoadmapItemStatusChanged } from '../../events/RoadmapEvents.js';

export class RoadmapItem {
  // Other properties...
  public readonly status: Status;
  private domainEvents: DomainEvent[] = [];
  
  // Constructor and other methods...
  
  public updateStatus(newStatus: Status, roadmapId: string, timeframeId: string, initiativeId: string): RoadmapItem {
    if (this.status.equals(newStatus)) {
      return this;
    }
    
    const item = new RoadmapItem(
      this.id,
      this.title,
      this.description,
      newStatus,
      this.relatedEntities,
      this.notes
    );
    
    const event = new RoadmapItemStatusChanged(
      roadmapId,
      timeframeId,
      initiativeId,
      this.id,
      this.status,
      newStatus
    );
    
    item.registerEvent(event);
    return item;
  }
  
  public registerEvent(event: DomainEvent): void {
    this.domainEvents.push(event);
  }
  
  public releaseEvents(): DomainEvent[] {
    const events = [...this.domainEvents];
    this.domainEvents = [];
    return events;
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Create Domain Services

1. Implement domain services for cross-entity operations:

```typescript
// src/domain/services/RoadmapPriorityService.ts
import { Roadmap } from '../entities/roadmap/Roadmap.js';
import { Priority } from '../value-objects/Priority.js';

export class RoadmapPriorityService {
  /**
   * Validates that roadmap initiatives follow priority rules
   * (e.g., can't have more than 5 high-priority items)
   */
  public validateInitiativePriorities(roadmap: Roadmap): { valid: boolean; message?: string } {
    let highPriorityCount = 0;
    
    for (const timeframe of roadmap.timeframes) {
      for (const initiative of timeframe.initiatives) {
        if (initiative.priority.isHigh) {
          highPriorityCount++;
        }
      }
    }
    
    if (highPriorityCount > 5) {
      return {
        valid: false,
        message: `Too many high-priority initiatives (${highPriorityCount}). Maximum allowed is 5.`
      };
    }
    
    return { valid: true };
  }
  
  /**
   * Rebalances priorities across initiatives to ensure proper distribution
   */
  public rebalancePriorities(roadmap: Roadmap): Roadmap {
    let updatedRoadmap = roadmap;
    
    const highPriorityCount = this.countInitiativesByPriority(roadmap, Priority.HIGH);
    const maxHighPriority = 5;
    
    if (highPriorityCount > maxHighPriority) {
      // Downgrade some high priorities to medium based on certain rules
      // This would modify the roadmap using the immutable update pattern
      // ...implementation details...
    }
    
    return updatedRoadmap;
  }
  
  /**
   * Counts initiatives by priority
   */
  private countInitiativesByPriority(roadmap: Roadmap, priority: Priority): number {
    let count = 0;
    
    for (const timeframe of roadmap.timeframes) {
      for (const initiative of timeframe.initiatives) {
        if (initiative.priority.equals(priority)) {
          count++;
        }
      }
    }
    
    return count;
  }
}
```

### Phase 5: Refactor Application Services

1. Split RoadmapService.ts into smaller, more focused services:

```typescript
// src/application/roadmap/RoadmapQueryService.ts
import { IRoadmapRepository } from '../../domain/repositories/RoadmapRepository.js';
import { Roadmap } from '../../domain/entities/roadmap/Roadmap.js';

export class RoadmapQueryService {
  constructor(private readonly roadmapRepository: IRoadmapRepository) {}
  
  public async getRoadmapById(id: string): Promise<Roadmap | null> {
    return this.roadmapRepository.findById(id);
  }
  
  public async getAllRoadmaps(): Promise<Roadmap[]> {
    return this.roadmapRepository.findAll();
  }
  
  // Other query methods...
}
```

```typescript
// src/application/roadmap/RoadmapManagementService.ts
import { IRoadmapRepository } from '../../domain/repositories/RoadmapRepository.js';
import { Roadmap } from '../../domain/entities/roadmap/Roadmap.js';
import { RoadmapPriorityService } from '../../domain/services/RoadmapPriorityService.js';
import { EventDispatcher } from '../../domain/events/EventDispatcher.js';

export class RoadmapManagementService {
  constructor(
    private readonly roadmapRepository: IRoadmapRepository,
    private readonly priorityService: RoadmapPriorityService,
    private readonly eventDispatcher: EventDispatcher
  ) {}
  
  public async createRoadmap(params: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    version: string;
    owner: string;
  }): Promise<Roadmap> {
    const roadmap = Roadmap.create(
      params.title,
      params.description,
      params.version,
      params.owner
    );
    
    await this.roadmapRepository.save(roadmap);
    
    // Release and dispatch any domain events
    this.dispatchEvents(roadmap);
    
    return roadmap;
  }
  
  // Other command methods...
  
  private dispatchEvents(roadmap: Roadmap): void {
    const events = roadmap.releaseEvents();
    events.forEach(event => this.eventDispatcher.dispatch(event));
  }
}
```

## Implementation Progress and Priorities

### Completed
✅ **Phase 1: Split Roadmap.ts**
- ✓ Created directory structure for roadmap entities
- ✓ Extracted Roadmap, RoadmapTimeframe, RoadmapInitiative, and RoadmapItem into separate files
- ✓ Created index.ts for clean exports
- ✓ Added backward compatibility in the original location
- ✓ Updated imports in affected files

✅ **Phase 2: Split RoadmapHandlers.ts**
- ✓ Created directory structure for specialized handlers
- ✓ Split into RoadmapManagementHandlers and RoadmapNoteHandlers
- ✓ Added backward compatibility with deprecation notices
- ✓ Created RoadmapJsonFileStorage to handle storage concerns properly
- ✓ Ensured proper type safety with error handling

### Upcoming Priorities (Revised)

1. **Phase 2: Split Remaining Large Service Files (High)**
   - ✅ Split RoadmapHandlers.ts (666 lines) into separate handler files by responsibility
   - ✅ Split RoadmapService.ts (597 lines) into more focused service classes:
     - Created RoadmapQueryService for read operations
     - Created RoadmapCommandService for write operations
     - Created RoadmapApplicationService as a facade combining both services
     - Maintained backward compatibility with re-exports and deprecation notices
   - ✅ Applied Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to separate read/write operations

2. **Phase 3: Implement Value Objects (High)**
   - Create Priority, Status, Category value objects
   - Update roadmap entity code to use value objects instead of primitives
   - Add validation and business rules to value objects

3. **Phase 4: Implement Domain Events (Medium)**
   - Set up domain event infrastructure
   - Update entities to register and release events
   - Create event handlers for cross-aggregate coordination

4. **Phase 5: Add Domain Services (Medium)**
   - Create RoadmapPriorityService and similar services
   - Move cross-entity business rules to domain services

## Conclusion

The domain model analysis reveals a codebase with good DDD alignment but with several opportunities for improvement. The implementation plan provided here focuses on the most critical improvements first: reducing file size through better organization, replacing primitives with value objects, and adding domain events and services.

By implementing these changes, we'll achieve:

1. Better code organization and maintainability
2. More expressive domain modeling
3. Improved enforcement of business rules
4. Easier coordination between aggregates
5. Clearer separation of concerns

These changes support our long-term goal of building a robust, maintainable domain model that accurately represents the business domain while remaining flexible enough to evolve as requirements change.
