# Code Refactoring

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring processes applied to major components of the software planning tool to improve maintainability, readability, and adherence to clean code principles. The primary goal was to break down large monolithic files into smaller, more focused files with clear responsibilities.

## GovernanceServer Refactoring

### Before Refactoring

Before the refactoring, the GovernanceServer component had the following issues:

- **GovernanceServer.ts**: 1963 lines, far exceeding the recommended maximum of 200-300 lines
- All handler logic was contained in a single large switch statement
- Multiple responsibilities mixed together
- Difficult to maintain and extend
- Hard to test individual pieces of functionality

### Refactoring Approach

We followed these principles during the refactoring:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class should have only one reason to change
2. **Domain-Driven Design**: Organize code by domain concepts
3. **Keep files small**: No file should exceed 300 lines of code
4. **Semantic cohesion**: Group related functionality together

### Refactoring Steps

1. **Identified domain categories**:
   - Document-related handlers
   - Task-related handlers
   - Planning-related handlers
   - Version control handlers

2. **Created specialized handler classes**:
   - Extracted document handlers to dedicated files (PRD, Epic, User Story, Research)
   - Extracted task handlers to dedicated files (Task Creation, Task Management, File Operations)
   - Extracted planning handlers to dedicated files (Session, Search, Sprint)
   - Extracted version control handlers to a dedicated file

3. **Created a central ActionHandler**:
   - Implemented a dispatcher pattern
   - Centralized routing of actions to appropriate handlers
   - Made handler selection explicit and self-documenting

4. **Updated GovernanceServer**:
   - Reduced to a thin server layer that delegates to appropriate handlers
   - Focused on configuration and server lifecycle management

### Results

After refactoring, we achieved the following improvements:

- **GovernanceServer.ts**: Reduced from 1963 to 864 lines
- **New files**: 17 smaller, focused files with clear responsibilities
- **Maximum file size**: All files are now under 300 lines
- **Improved organization**: Clear domain separation
- **Better testability**: Each handler can be tested in isolation
- **Easier maintenance**: Changes to one domain don't affect others
- **Simplified extension**: Adding new handlers is straightforward

### File Breakdown

| Category | Files | Lines of Code | % of Codebase |
|----------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Core | 3 | 1368 | 47.8% |
| Task | 3 | 496 | 17.3% |
| Document | 3 | 326 | 11.4% |
| Planning | 3 | 312 | 10.9% |
| Version Control | 1 | 177 | 6.2% |
| Exports | 4 | 25 | 0.9% |
| **Total** | **17** | **2864** | **100%** |

### Future Improvements

The codebase could be further improved by:

1. Reducing the size of GovernanceServer.ts even more by:
   - Extracting the tool/resource registration logic to dedicated classes
   - Moving server setup to a separate factory class

2. Adding comprehensive unit tests for each handler class

3. Implementing proper dependency injection for all services

4. Adding more detailed documentation for each handler class

5. Considering a more modular architecture with dynamic handler registration

### Conclusion

The refactoring has significantly improved the GovernanceServer component structure, making it more maintainable and aligned with software engineering best practices. It preserves all functionality while making the code easier to understand, test, and extend.

## RoadmapService CQRS Refactoring

### Before Refactoring

Before the refactoring, the RoadmapService component had the following issues:

- **RoadmapService.ts**: 597 lines, far exceeding the recommended maximum of 200-300 lines
- Mixed read and write operations in the same service
- Lack of clear separation of concerns
- Difficult to test individual methods independently
- File growing in size with each new roadmap feature added

### Refactoring Approach

We applied the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to separate the service into distinct components:

1. **Command-Query Separation**: Divide operations into two categories:
   - **Queries**: Read-only operations (never modify state)
   - **Commands**: Write operations (modify state)

2. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has only one responsibility
   - Query service focuses exclusively on retrieving data
   - Command service focuses exclusively on modifying data

3. **Facade Pattern**: Provide a unified interface that combines both services
   - Maintain backward compatibility for existing code
   - Delegate to specialized services internally

4. **Immutability**: Ensure robust domain state management
   - Commands return new objects instead of modifying existing ones
   - Improve predictability and testability

### Refactoring Steps

1. **Split RoadmapService.ts into three specialized services**:
   - `RoadmapQueryService.ts`: All read operations
   - `RoadmapCommandService.ts`: All write operations
   - `RoadmapApplicationService.ts`: Facade combining both services

2. **Implemented proper dependency injection**:
   - Both specialized services take repositories as constructor parameters
   - Facade service takes specialized services as constructor parameters

3. **Added clear documentation**:
   - Explained CQRS pattern in comments
   - Added deprecation notices in the original file
   - Included method documentation for all public methods

4. **Maintained backward compatibility**:
   - Kept original RoadmapService.ts as a re-export of the new facade
   - Added appropriate deprecation warnings
   - Ensured identical method signatures

### Results

After refactoring, we achieved the following improvements:

- **Original RoadmapService.ts**: Reduced from 597 to 97 lines (re-export facade)
- **New files**:
  - `RoadmapApplicationService.ts`: 323 lines (Facade combining query and command)
  - `RoadmapCommandService.ts`: 273 lines (Write operations)
  - `RoadmapQueryService.ts`: 193 lines (Read operations)
  - `index.ts`: 3 lines (Exports)
- **Improved testability**: Each service can be tested in isolation
- **Better maintainability**: Changes to queries don't affect commands
- **Clearer responsibility boundaries**: Each service has a single, well-defined job

### Benefits of CQRS

The CQRS pattern provides several benefits:

1. **Optimized Performance**:
   - Query models can be optimized for fast reads
   - Command models can be optimized for validation and consistency

2. **Scalability**:
   - Read and write workloads can scale independently
   - Different persistence strategies can be applied to each side

3. **Security**:
   - Easier to implement strict access controls for commands
   - Read models can have more permissive access

4. **Evolution**:
   - Models can evolve independently based on their specific needs
   - New requirements often affect only one side

### Conclusion

The CQRS refactoring has significantly improved the architecture of the RoadmapService component, making it more maintainable, testable, and aligned with domain-driven design principles. This pattern provides a clear separation of concerns while maintaining backward compatibility for existing code.
