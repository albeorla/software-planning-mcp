# Governed Planner Workflow (DDD/SOLID Refined)

This document guides interactions with the coding agent (Claude Code) within this repository. It focuses on the workflow enforced by the integrated governed_planner MCP server, which is designed following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and SOLID principles for maintainability and clear separation of concerns.

## Implementation Status

**Status: In Progress**

Reference CLAUDE.md for detailed implementation task tracking.

## Governance Server

The project implements a governance server that acts as the sole intermediary between Claude Code and all other tools. This ensures strict workflow enforcement by controlling all interactions through a single point of access.

### Configuration

To use the governance server alongside Claude's built-in capabilities, configure Claude Code to allow both direct tool access and governance MCP server tools in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Bash",
    "View",
    "Edit",
    "GlobTool",
    "GrepTool",
    "LSTool",
    "BatchTool",
    "AgentTool",
    "mcp__governance__*"
  ]
}
```

This hybrid approach allows Claude to directly perform file operations while using the governance server for workflow-specific operations like planning, task tracking, and state transitions.

### Running the Governance Server

To run the governance server:

```bash
pnpm run governance
```

This will start the governance MCP server with the inspector interface for debugging.

### Governance Tools

The governance server exposes high-level actions that map to the workflow phases:

#### Planning Phase
- `mcp__governance__start_planning_session`: Start a new planning session for a PRD/Goal
- `mcp__governance__add_planning_thought`: Record a thought during planning
- `mcp__governance__create_epic`: Create a new epic
- `mcp__governance__create_story`: Create a user story
- `mcp__governance__create_task`: Create a new implementation task
- `mcp__governance__create_subtask`: Create a subtask within a task
- `mcp__governance__list_tasks`: List all tasks in the current plan
- `mcp__governance__create_sprint`: Create a new sprint with selected stories/tasks
- `mcp__governance__get_sprint_info`: Get information about a sprint

#### Implementation Phase
- `mcp__governance__start_implementation`: Start implementing a specific task
- `mcp__governance__update_task_status`: Update the status of a task (in-progress, blocked)
- `mcp__governance__track_file_read`: Track file reads (actual reading done through Claude's View tool)
- `mcp__governance__track_file_edit`: Track file edits (actual editing done through Claude's Edit tool)
- `mcp__governance__log_daily_work`: Record work done for the day
- `mcp__governance__complete_implementation`: Mark implementation as complete

#### Review and Commit Phase
- `mcp__governance__start_code_review`: Begin code review process
- `mcp__governance__commit_changes`: Commit changes for the task
- `mcp__governance__create_branch`: Create a feature branch
- `mcp__governance__create_pull_request`: Create a pull request
- `mcp__governance__update_sprint_status`: Update sprint status with completed work

#### Available in Multiple Phases
- `mcp__governance__search_code`: Search for code patterns (planning/implementation)
- `mcp__governance__run_command`: Run allowed command based on current phase

The governance server enforces the workflow by only allowing certain actions during specific phases and validating the state transitions.

## Guiding Principles

- **Bounded Contexts**: The server's functionality is divided into distinct contexts (Planning, Documentation, Version Control, Thinking) each with its own Application Service.
- **API-Driven Workflow**: The agent interacts with high-level use cases exposed as MCP tools. These tools map directly to methods on the Application Services.
- **Repository-Owned State**: Core domain state (Goals, Todos, etc.) is managed within the repository via Infrastructure implementations (e.g., JSON files in .docs/).
- **Application Layer Governance**: Workflow rules and document interactions are orchestrated within the Application Services, ensuring consistency.
- **Thin Transport Layer**: The MCP server (index.ts) acts primarily as a router, delegating requests to the appropriate Application Service.

## User Journey & Interaction Patterns with Governance Server

Here's the workflow now enforced by the Governance Server, which acts as the sole intermediary between Claude Code and all other tools:

### 1. Task Assignment:
- **User Input**: Provide a clear task description with PRD reference.
  ```bash
  claude "Implement the Eisenhower Matrix feature for todost (PRD-EM-01), see sprint plan .docs/sprints/sprint_2025-05-06.md"
  ```
- **Agent Action**: Consults this `DESIGN.md` file and examines the referenced PRD and sprint plan.

  ```
  Tool Call: mcp__governance__start_planning_session
  Arguments: { 
    "prdId": "PRD-EM-01", 
    title": "Implement Eisenhower Matrix feature for todost",
    "sprintId": "2025-05-06"
  }
  ```
- **Governance â†’ Planner**: Governance server validates the request and proxies to the planner.
  - Updates workflow state to PLANNING phase
  - Loads the PRD document for reference
  - Associates with the specified sprint
  - Calls PlanningApplicationService.startPlanningSession()
- **Governance â†’ Agent**: Returns sequential thinking prompt and workflow state.

## Key Benefits of the Hybrid Governance Approach

- **Balanced Control**: The governance server manages workflow state while Claude retains direct tool access for efficiency
- **Workflow Structure**: The governance server provides clear phase transitions and state tracking
- **Direct File Operations**: Claude can use native file tools for immediate feedback and performance
- **Audit Trail**: Key workflow transitions and decisions are logged in the governance state
- **Flexibility with Structure**: Combines the freedom of direct tool access with the structure of workflow governance
- **Best of Both Worlds**: Uses governance for high-level processes while leveraging Claude's built-in capabilities for implementation details

## Key Tools (Mapping to Application Services)

- start_planning(goal: string) â†’ PlanningApplicationService.startPlanningSession
- add_todo(...) â†’ PlanningApplicationService.addTodoToCurrentPlan
- get_todos() â†’ PlanningApplicationService.getCurrentTodos
- complete_task(todoId: string, summaryPoints: string[]) â†’ PlanningApplicationService.completeTask (Orchestrates Planning & Documentation updates)
- remove_todo(todoId: string) â†’ PlanningApplicationService.removeTodo (Potentially orchestrates Documentation update)
- add_thought(thought: string) â†’ ThinkingApplicationService.addThought
- commit_changes(todoId: string, message: string) â†’ VersionControlApplicationService.commitTaskChanges

This structure provides clearer boundaries, enhances testability (Application/Domain layers can be tested independently of Infrastructure), and makes the system more adaptable to future changes by isolating responsibilities within specific contexts and layers.
